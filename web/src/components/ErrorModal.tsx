/**
 * Owner-reported (Delete Youth, but the same root problem applies to any
 * error inside a modal whose content can scroll -- Save, photo upload, etc.
 * all had the identical bug): an inline banner near the top of a tall,
 * scrollable modal is easy to miss entirely if the user is scrolled down
 * near whatever action just failed (e.g. Delete at the very bottom) -- it
 * "looks like nothing is happening" unless they know to scroll back up.
 * A dismissible dialog is impossible to miss regardless of scroll position.
 *
 * z-[90] -- above every other modal in the app (the highest existing one,
 * PhotoCropperModal, is z-[80]), so an error surfaces on top even if it
 * happened while a nested modal (e.g. the photo cropper) was still open.
 * Its own portal keeps it from being clipped by a parent modal's own
 * overflow-y-auto scroll container.
