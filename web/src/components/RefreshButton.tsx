/**
 * Owner-requested: sits below the Home link in every page header. Cheap by
 * design -- clicking it just re-runs the same server-side data fetch that
 * already happens on every normal page load (`router.refresh()`, Next.js's
 * built-in "re-fetch this route's data without a full reload" primitive),
 * the exact same work a manual browser refresh or simply revisiting the
 * page would already trigger. No new class of load on the app: it's an
 * on-demand, per-click action a person has to actually press, not
 * something that polls or runs automatically.
 *
 * Owner-reported: nothing visibly happened between the click and the fresh
 * data arriving, so people clicked again and again. The refresh now runs
 * inside a transition -- the icon becomes a spinner and further clicks are
 * ignored until the data is back.
 *
 * Pass `onRefresh` for a screen that already has its own reload callback
 * (e.g. ServiceCalendarModal, which isn't a real route and reloads its
 * data via a prop) instead of the router-based default. If it returns a
 * promise, the spinner lasts until that resolves.
