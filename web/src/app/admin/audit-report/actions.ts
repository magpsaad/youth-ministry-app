/** REQUIREMENTS.md §3.11 -- the 15,000-row cap is deliberate (owner's
 * explicit choice): it keeps the report's data set bounded, and doubles as
 * a soft prompt to use the Admin-only archive tool (archiveAuditLogAction)
 * once history gets long enough to bump into it. Most-recent-first, so if
 * it's ever hit, what quietly drops off is the oldest activity, not the
 * newest.
 *
 * A plain `.limit(15000)` never actually returned more than 1000 rows,
 * though -- confirmed directly: this project's Supabase instance caps a
 * single response at its configured `db-max-rows` (1000) regardless of
 * what the client asks for, silently, no error. Paged via fetchAllRows
 * (lib/pagination.ts) so the real cap is 15,000, not 1,000 -- audit_log
 * already has 4,000+ rows, well past that ceiling. */
