/**
 * Owner-reported: every tab under a cohort (Dashboard/Members/Attendance/
 * Outreach/Reports, including the "all cohorts" combined view -- which
 * experiences this worst, given how much more it fetches) felt like it took
 * "a few seconds" before anything appeared at all, even though each tab's
 * own page.tsx already streams its own data in behind a loading.tsx
 * skeleton. The real cause: THIS layout's own data (the access check, app
 * settings, last service date, and -- for a single cohort -- the group-name
 * lookup) ran first and blocked ALL rendering, header and tab bar included,
 * before a page's own loading.tsx ever got a chance to show anything. Per
 * this Next.js version's own loading.js docs: a layout's uncached fetches
 * are NOT covered by a child page's loading.tsx -- "navigation blocks until
 * the layout finishes rendering" unless the layout wraps its own data
 * access in its own Suspense boundary, which is what this file now does.
 *
 * GroupNavShell itself needs no data beyond its props, so the fallback
 * below renders the exact same component with safe placeholder values --
 * header/logo/tab bar all appear and are fully clickable (Home, every tab)
 * instantly, then swap to the real title/cohort name/last-service-date the
 * moment this layout's own fetch resolves. Once resolved, the requested
 * tab's own page renders inside it exactly as before, with its own
 * loading.tsx taking over for whatever that page still needs to fetch.
 *
 * The "are you even signed in" check stays here, OUTSIDE the Suspense
 * boundary -- confirmed by testing: moving it inside (alongside the
 * slower role/permission lookups) let `{children}` start rendering
 * concurrently with that check, so a signed-out hit would briefly let the
 * requested tab's own page fire its data query before the redirect won the
 * race, surfacing as a raw "permission denied" Postgres error in the
 * server logs (RLS still blocked it -- no data ever leaked -- but it's
 * noisy and wasted work). `getCurrentUser()` alone is cheap, so gating on
 * it here costs nothing.
