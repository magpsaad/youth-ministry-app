/**
 * REQUIREMENTS.md §8.1 -- the skeleton loading states enhancement had a real
 * gap: `[groupId]/layout.tsx` (which renders GroupNavShell -- the header and
 * tab bar) does its own data fetching (group name, app settings, last
 * service date) and had no `loading.tsx` of its own. A route segment's
 * `loading.tsx` only wraps *that* segment; since the layout itself had none,
 * nothing at all could render -- not the header, not the tabs, not even
 * dashboard/loading.tsx's own skeleton -- until the layout's fetch finished.
 * The old landing page would just sit there with the "Load [Member] Data"
 * button's own "Loading…" text as the only feedback, however long that took
 * (owner-reported).
 *
 * This fixes that: a full shell-shaped skeleton (header, tab bar, the "My
 * Assigned List"/Last Service Date row, then a generic content skeleton)
 * shows the instant navigation into any group begins, regardless of which
 * tab. Since "Load [Member] Data" always lands on the Dashboard first, the
 * content skeleton below is shaped like Dashboard's own -- once the layout
 * resolves and the real nav shell renders, Dashboard's own loading.tsx (if
 * its own data is still pending) takes over seamlessly from a near-identical
 * skeleton, so the handoff isn't visually jarring.
