 * REQUIREMENTS.md §3.11/§6.14 -- writes one audit_log row for the given
 * action, honoring audit_config's per-action-type enable/disable switch
 * (silently skips if that type is turned off). Best-effort: a failure here
 * (including "type disabled") never throws back into the calling action --
 * the underlying app operation this is attached to must always succeed
 * regardless of audit logging's own state.
 *
 * Takes the caller's userId explicitly rather than calling
 * `supabase.auth.getUser()` itself, since every call site already has it on
 * hand -- avoids reintroducing the redundant-auth-call performance bug fixed
 * earlier in this project.
